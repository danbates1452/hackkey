### Development Environment Setup:
0. Install Python 3.12.2 https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3122/
1. Create a virtual environment in the same directory as this readme. `python -m venv venv` (or Windows users without Python 3.12.2 in path: `c:/Users/<User>/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python312/python.exe -m venv venv`). You should see your virtual environment has been created in the subdirectory 'venv'.
3. Activate your virtual environment by running its activate script: `./venv/Scripts/activate` (Mac/Linux: `./venv/bin/activate`) . You can now use 'pip' and 'python' freely as they're in the PATH of your new virtual environment.
4. Run `pip install -r ./requirements.txt` to install our dependencies.
